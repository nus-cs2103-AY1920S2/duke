# Project Duke

Project Duke is a educational software project written to hone my incremental software development skills, while applying as many Java and SE techniques as possible along the way.

The project aims to build a product named Duke, a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps a person to keep track of various things. The name Duke was chosen in honor of Duke, the Java Mascot.
