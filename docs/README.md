## Features 

### Task Types: To-Dos, Deadlines, and Events

There are 3 different types of tasks that can recorded by the task list: To-Dos, Deadlines, and Events. To-Dos are tasks that are not bounded by a date and time. Deadlines and Events are bounded by a date and time. 

### Task List 

This application has an in bult task list that keeps track of all tasks. Each task is assigned an index number dependant on the time at which the task was added into the list, in ascending order. The task list also keeps track of the status of each task, if the task has been completed or not. Tasks can be mark as done, as well as removed from the list. The task list can be printed out into the GUI for user viewing, and the task list features a simple search function to search for tasks in the list.

### Data Saving

Task list data is saved into a `.txt` data file to be loaded into the application in every session. At the end of the session, all changes to the task list will be written back to the data file for use in the next session.
