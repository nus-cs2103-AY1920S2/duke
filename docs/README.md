track of their tasks. Generally, user can add, mark 
the task as complete, delete and find a combination of 
tasks.

## Instructions
  1. Download the jar file [here](https://github.com/nhamhung/duke/releases/tag/A-Release).
  2. Open the jar file to launch the app.
  3. Type in the text box your command or instruction. Hit `Enter` or the `Send` button to execute.
  4. See Section [4. Usage](#usage) for different commands.

## Features 

### Overview

> The app currently processes 3 types of user tasks: **Todo**, **Deadline** and **Event**. Each of these tasks will require a different input from the user to be recorded and kept track of their completion. 

### Task List

> All the tasks are stored in the list of tasks according to the order they were added. Each task is mapped to an index which corresponds to its position in the list. User can thus refer to a specific task or multiple tasks based on their indexes. There is also a "list" command which allows user to check the ordering of the tasks.

### Storage

> The tasks are stored to and loaded from "/data/duke.txt". When the application starts, data is loaded from "/data/duke.txt" into the task list to be displayed or manipulated. After each user command, if there is any modification to any task or the task list, the data in "/data/duke.txt" will be overwritten with the current state of the task list.
