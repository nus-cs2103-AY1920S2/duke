  Example of usage: 

  `todo clean my room`

  Expected outcome:

  `Got it. I've added this task:`<br />
  `[T][✗] clean my room`<br />
  `Now you have 2 tasks in the list.`<br />

* ### `deadline [name of task] /by [YYYY-MM-DD HHMM]` - adds a deadline :green_book:

  A Deadline is a task that has a date and time argument. Users can record down tasks with deadlines.

  Example of usage: 

  `deadline return book /by 2020-03-12 1800`

  Expected outcome:

  `Got it. I've added this task:`<br />
  `[D][✗] return book (by: Mar 12 2020 1800)`<br />
  `Now you have 3 tasks in the list.`<br />

* ### `event [name of task] /by [YYYY-MM-DD HHMM-HHMM]` - adds an event :orange_book:

  An Event is a task that has a date, start time and end time argument. Users can record down tasks that will happen on a certain day as well as the duration of the event.

  Expected outcome:

  `Got it. I've added this task:`<br />

  `Now you have 4 tasks in the list.`<br />

* ### `done [index]` - marks a task as done :ballot_box_with_check:

  Each task has a status assigned to it. When users are done with a task, they can choose to mark it as done.

  Example of usage: 

  `done 1`

  Expected outcome:

  `Nice! I've marked this task as done:`<br />
  `[T][✓] read documentation`<br />

* ### `delete [index]` - deletes a task :x:

  After users are done with a task, they can delete it to free up storage space.

  Example of usage: 

  `delete 1`

  Expected outcome:

  `Noted. I've removed this task:`<br />
  `[T][✓] read documentation`<br />
  `Now you have 3 tasks in the list.`<br />

* ### `find [keyword(s)]` - searches for matching tasks :mag:

  Users can filter out tasks according to the keywords.

  Example of usage: 

  `find study`
