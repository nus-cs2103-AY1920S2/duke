# User Guide for Duke 

A versatile task manager every command-line user has been waiting for. 

## Features 

Duke allows you to add different types of Tasks, search for tasks using keywords, mark tasks as completed, 
list all tasks and delete any task. Tasks are categorised into three categories:

- ToDo: A simple todo task with just a description. 
- Deadline: A task that allows you to specify a 'by' property, in addition to a description, to specify the date 
you need to complete it. 
- Event: A task that allows you to specify a 'at' property in addition to a description, to specify the 
timing of the event 

#### Add Tasks 

- Add a todo using the command: `todo <description>`. For example, `todo write user guide for duke` will create 
a todo description *write user guide for duke* to your list of tasks.
