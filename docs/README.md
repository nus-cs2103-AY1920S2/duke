# User Guide

## 1. Introduction

Duke is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their tasks and events. More importantly, Duke is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Duke can help keep track and organise your tasks and events faster than a traditional GUI application!

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer
2. Download the latest `duke-0.1.3.jar` [here](https://github.com/hhjoel/duke/releases/download/A-Release3/duke-0.1.3.jar)
3. Copy the `jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Duke Task Manager
4. Double click the `jar` file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
