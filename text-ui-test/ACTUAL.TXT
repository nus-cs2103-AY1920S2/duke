     Hello! I'm hakunaMatata.HakunaMatata, a task list chat box
     You can key in your tasks and I'll keep track of them for you.

     ============================== Guide ==============================
     There are three types of tasks I'm able to keep track of.
         Todo: use "todo + description" to create (e.g. todo taskInfo).
         Deadline: use "deadline + description + /by + date" to create (e.g. deadline taskInfo /by June 6th).
         Event: use "event + description + /at + date" to create (e.g. event taskInfo /at Mon 2-4pm).

     You can also use "list" to check the recorded tasks.
     Or use "done + task index" to mark the task as done. 

     To terminate me, please use "bye".

     What can I do for you?
