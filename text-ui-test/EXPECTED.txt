	Is this the first time I'm talking with you?
	I can't do everything for you, you know? Here's what I do:
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	list 							View current tasks.
	todo [desc.] 					Create ToDo.
	event [desc.] /at [time] 		Create Event.
	deadline [desc.] /by [time] 	Create Deadline.
	done [index] 					Complete task at index.
	find [word(s)] 					Find tasks with said word(s).
	delete [index] 					Delete task at index.
	bye 							Bid farewell (sounds great!).
	help 							See this message again.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	Accepted time formats are:
	d/m/YY 							d/m/YY HHmm
	Today/Tonight/Tomorrow 			Monday/Tuesday etc.
	━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
	━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
	Not bad, I found the following:
		1.	[T][✓] Go for a run
			[REF INDEX FOR DELETE/DONE: 1]
	━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
	━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
	Great! One less thing for me to track for you.
		[E][✘] Go for CS2103 class (at: Friday 2-4pm) [DELETED]
	Now I'm tracking 4 tasks for you.

	Bye, is it? Shoo shoo then.
	Don't need to worry, I'll remember what you told me today.
